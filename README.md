In this project firstly we preprocessed the csv file . later we find that The majority of the restaurants fall into the dining category.
we find out that offline orders received lower rating when compared to online orders.
we also visualized the average spent cost in a restaurent by couple.
Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
